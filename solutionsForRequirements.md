# Login and Registration

## Description
Users should be able to access the app's features and personalized content by logging in with their existing social media accounts or creating a new account.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Social Media Login:** Users should have the option to log in to the app using their existing social media accounts, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter.
2. **Account Creation:** Users who don't have social media accounts should be able to create a new account directly within the app.
3. **Email Verification:** After creating a new account, users should receive an email verification link to confirm their email address.
4. **Password Recovery:** Users should have the ability to recover their account password in case they forget it. This can be done through a password reset feature that sends a password reset link to their registered email address.
5. **Remember Me:** The app should provide an option for users to stay logged in across multiple sessions, using a "Remember Me" functionality.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Security:** User account information and authentication credentials should be securely stored and transmitted to prevent unauthorized access.
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The login and registration process should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, guiding users through the necessary steps with clear instructions and feedback.

## Constraints
1. **Social Media Integration:** The app should integrate with the chosen social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Google, Twitter) to facilitate seamless login and registration.
2. **Compliance:** The login and registration process should comply with relevant privacy regulations, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).

## Assumptions
1. **Internet Connectivity:** Users are assumed to have an internet connection to access the login and registration functionality.
2. **Social Media Account Availability:** Users are assumed to have existing social media accounts if they choose to log in using that method.

## Solution Approach
To fulfill the login and registration requirements, we will utilize the following technologies:

- For the Spring Framework: We will leverage the Spring Security module to handle user authentication and authorization. Additionally, we will integrate Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution, to provide social media login and account creation functionalities.

- For Micronaut Framework: We will use Micronaut Security to handle user authentication and authorization. Similarly, we will integrate Keycloak with Micronaut to enable social media login and account creation capabilities.

Please refer to the respective documentation and configuration guides for Spring Security and Keycloak integration or Micronaut Security and Keycloak integration for detailed implementation steps.
