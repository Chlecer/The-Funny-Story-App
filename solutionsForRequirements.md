# Login and Registration

## Description
Users should be able to access the app's features and personalized content by logging in with their existing social media accounts or creating a new account.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Social Media Login:** Users should have the option to log in to the app using their existing social media accounts, such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter. (This step bypasses the need for account creation.)
2. **Account Creation:** Users who don't have social media accounts should be able to create a new account directly within the app. This includes the following sub-steps:
   - User Registration Form: Provide a registration form where users can enter their desired username, email address, and password.
   - Account Creation: Upon submitting the registration form, create a new account for the user within the app's database.
   - Email Verification: Send an email verification link to the user's provided email address for confirmation.
3. **Password Recovery (App Accounts Only):** Users with app accounts (not created through social media) should have the ability to recover their account password in case they forget it. This includes the following sub-steps:
   - Password Reset Request: Provide a "Forgot Password" functionality where users can request a password reset.
   - Email Notification: Upon receiving a password reset request, send an email to the user's registered email address with a password reset link.
   - Password Reset: Users should be able to reset their password by clicking on the provided password reset link and following the instructions.

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Security:** User account information and authentication credentials should be securely stored and transmitted to prevent unauthorized access.
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The login and registration process should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface, guiding users through the necessary steps with clear instructions and feedback.

## Constraints
1. **Social Media Integration:** The app should integrate with the chosen social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Google, Twitter) to facilitate seamless login and registration.
2. **Compliance:** The login and registration process should comply with relevant privacy regulations, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act).

## Solution Approach
To fulfill the login, registration, and password recovery requirements, we will utilize the following technologies:

- For the Spring Framework: We will leverage the Spring Security module to handle user authentication and authorization. Additionally, we will integrate Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution, to provide social media login and account creation functionalities.

- For Micronaut Framework: We will use Micronaut Security to handle user authentication and authorization. Similarly, we will integrate Keycloak with Micronaut to enable social media login and account creation capabilities.

- For Quarkus Framework: We will utilize Quarkus Security to handle user authentication and authorization. We will integrate Keycloak with Quarkus to support social media login and account creation functionalities.

Please refer to the respective documentation and configuration guides for Spring Security and Keycloak integration, Micronaut Security and Keycloak integration, as well as Quarkus Security and Keycloak integration, for detailed implementation steps.
